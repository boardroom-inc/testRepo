**Index Coop is an index provider and decentralized asset management protocol. Its primary product, the Defi Pulse Index (DPI), comprises a broadly diversified pool of governance tokens which is rebalanced monthly based on market capitalization.**

DPI rebalancing is handled viaÂ [Set Protocol](https://www.setprotocol.com/)'s auction mechanisms, eliminating risk of "divergence loss" that can exist with certain other rebalancing strategies. The Index Coop treasury receives a 0.95% annualized management fee from assets held in DPI, which can potentially accrue value to INDEX holders or support further development. INDEX holders also control voting rights of the governance tokens held within the DPI, positioning the protocol as a key participant in the wider decentralized governance ecosystem.

Formal proposals and longer term governance discussions happen primarily within the Index discourse forum, while most day to day community activity happens in the discord chat.

Index also has monthly governance calls which are shared in the discord "announcements" channel, and weekly breakout sessions for various aspects of the protocol. Those interested in getting involved can reach out to community members in discord for help with onboarding and invitations to working group meetings.

Governance Process
------------------

Index Coop uses the Snapshot off chain voting tool to hold governance votes, and also makes use of Discourse's native polling system (which grants 1 vote per account) for building consensus earlier in the proposal process.

INDEX holders are also able to excercise control over governance tokens held within the DPI index. Currently, only voting systems without locking or deposit functionality are supported (Compound, Uniswap, and Aave). When a vote in an underlying protocol is submitted on chain, a corresponding Snapshot poll is created to gauge INDEX holder sentiment. If a majority is reached with at least 5% of circulating INDEX tokens in support, the Index Coop multisig executes the vote on behalf of DPI token holdings.
