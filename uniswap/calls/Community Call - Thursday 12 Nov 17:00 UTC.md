### How can you participate/contribute?

-   Attend!

-   Make graphic design collateral for community use (poster background for events/announcements, slide deck themes, etc)

These are just a couple ideas, but I'm sure we'll find more ways to support each other as a community over time.

Looking forward to seeing everyone on Thursday! ![:beers:](https://sjc3.discourse-cdn.com/business6/images/emoji/apple/beers.png?v=9 ":beers:")
