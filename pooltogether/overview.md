**PoolTogether is a protocol for no-loss prize games on the Ethereum blockchain.**

The protocol:
1) Enables developers to build their own no-loss prize games 
2) Offers governance-managed no-loss prize games

*The PoolTogether protocol will be transitioning to decentralized governance. In the meantime, the core team serves as the interim governance body.*

PoolTogether Governance broadly serves two mandates:

-   Protocol Improvement
-   Prize Pool Management

### Protocol Improvement

Governance will guide the evolution of the protocol towards the goal of building products that create financial health. The primary functions of governance are to:

-   Set rewards for prize pool users
-   Approve & implement new yield sources for prize pools
-   Implement new prize strategies

In addition to these core functions governance may:

-   Propose integrations with L2 systems
-   Add additional prizes or rewards
-   Subsidized transactions
-   Insurance coverage
-   Anything else!

All Prize Pools created with Builders contribute a small fee to the **protocol reserve**. The reserve is retained by the protocol as sponsorship in the Prize Pool in which it accrued.

### Prize Pool Management

Governance also manages its own set of Prize Pools. These Prize Pools are displayed on the official [PoolTogether App](https://app-v3.pooltogether.com/).

### Comptroller

All Prize Pools link to a global protocol Comptroller. The Comptroller is owned by governance, and determines the reserve rate and rewards Prize Pools.
