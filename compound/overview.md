**Compound is a protocol for creating and managing money markets for lending crypto assets. Holders of the COMP token can make changes to the protocol by voting on and passing proposals.**

Most active community discussions take place in the [Compound Discord chat](https://discord.com/channels/402910780124561410/682253201701208169). More formal, long form discussions are hosted in the [Compound Discourse forum](https://www.comp.xyz/). By convention, proposals or code changes are posted and reviewed on [Github](https://github.com/compound-finance) before they are put up for a vote.

Governance Process
------------------

The Compound Finance website has a native [voting/delegation app](https://app.compound.finance/vote) and [governance dashboard](https://compound.finance/governance) that shows active and prior proposals, top addresses by token weight, and voting history. Compound uses the Compound governance architecture for proposals and voting.

Submitting a proposal requires 1% of voting power (100,000 COMP). For users who lack the necessary voting power themselves, they can create an autonomous proposal to gather delegations for the potential change, and the proposal can be submitted to full voting after crossing the 1% threshold. Once a proposal has been submitted, a snapshot is triggered to determine each address's voting weight, and voting is live for ~2.5 days. Proposals that gain majority support and meet the 4% of total votes quorum requirement are executed after a 2 day time-lock delay.
