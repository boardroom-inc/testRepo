## **Structure**
1. The `index.ts` file contains basic project metadata, as well as branding colors
2. Folders for each project contain the following:
    1. `overview.md` contains a project's governance overview. _This content is displayed in each project's 'Overview' tab, below its statistics._
    2. `logo.png` is a logo file displayed in various places accross the app, including protocol switcher.
    3. `header.png` is a logo file is displayed at the top of sidebar when that project is selected in the navigation.
    4. `calls` is a folder collects governance and community call agendas and meeting notes, displayed in each project's 'Calls' tab.
      
## **Global Protocol Changes**

### Protocol Information
Basic information of the protocol is saved in protocols object of index.ts file

```
  protocol_key: {
    name: "Protocol Name",
    path: "Path used in boardroom url",
    description: "Description of protocol",
    suffix: "Token",
    folder: "Folder name to host resources",
  },
```  

Edit the corresponding value in the object and raise a new PR for changes.

### Protocol Branding
 1. Add the unique protocol key in the object `protocolBranding` of index.ts if it does not exist. 
```
unique_protocol_key: {
    "--background-primary-nav": "#001529", // Background color for sidebar, header and header information in protocol pages
    "--color-text-nav": "#e7e8eb", // Color of text in sidebar, header and header information in protocol pages
    "--background-switcher-active": "#000000", // Background color of the active nav element in sidebar 
  },
```
 2. Add or edit the respective color variables and colors to the above object.
 3. Raise a PR with the changes.
 4. These changes should be reflected on the Boardroom portal a few days after the changes have been merged.

We have a codesandbox instance https://codesandbox.io/s/boardroombranding-q3u9z to visualize branding changes. Change the corresponding color variable in index.js file to have a sense of how the protocol pages will look after the updates

## **Adding Content**

### New Content Folders
New content folders will dynamically display a new item under the 'Resources' tab. Raise a new PR by following the steps below:

1. Create a new file in the calls folder of the protocol. _The Filename will be the title displayed in the 'Calls' tab list._
2. Add the call agenda and relevant meeting notes in the markdown file. The contents of the file will be displayed in the respective page.
3. Raise a PR with the changes.

### New Calendar Events

1. Add one or more new events to the `events.json` file of the protocol using the following format:

- **title**: The title of the event - this will be shown in the month and day view.
- **url**: A URL to link to when an event is clicked.
- **date**: The UTC date of the event in ISO 8601 format

```json
[
  {
    "title": "This is an example event.",
    "url": "https://example.com",
    "date": "2021-01-08T00:00:00.000Z"
  },
  {
    "title": "This is another example event.",
    "url": "https://example.com",
    "date": "2021-01-10T00:00:00.000Z"
  }
]
```

2. Raise a PR with the changes.

### New Project
Please keep in mind that the Boardroom team will need to add your project before it displays on the portal. Raise a new PR by following the steps below:

1. Add a new object to index.ts in the format of

```
  protocol_key: {
    name: "Protocol Name",
    path: "Path used in boardroom url",
    description: "Description of protocol",
    suffix: "Token",
    folder: "Folder name to host resources",
  },
```

2. Create a folder with the same name mentioned above in the root folder of the repo.
3. Add logo with the file name `logo.png` in the folder with an aspect ratio of 1:1. This will display in the project switcher and various other places in the app.
4. Add an image `header.png` which will display at the top sidebar. Ideal dimensions are 400 × 150 (W× H)
5. Add a folder with the name `calls` which will contain meeting note files.
6. Raise a PR with the changes.
